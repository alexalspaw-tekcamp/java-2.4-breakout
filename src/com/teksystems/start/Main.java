			Create 5 podcasts.
			Create 1 Podcasting Apps.

			It may not make the most sense, but suppose later a client asks for the ability to create a
			hybrid "playlist" that contains podcasts as well as songs. This would be a prime opportunity
			to create an abstraction (interface or abstract class). For generics there is an existing
			class where those could be added.

			Below are suggested method calls if you get those built out.
			Load podcasts into the podcasting app
			 - play and stop a podcast
			 - go to the next() and previous() podcasts
			 - stop()
			 - put a podcast on repeat()
       		 - show the playlist
       		 - remove a podcast from the playlist
